# Raft Consensus Algorithm Implementation

Welcome to the Raft Consensus Algorithm Implementation repository. This project contains a Python implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm, a popular protocol for achieving consensus in distributed systems. This repository is open to contributions and improvements from the developer community.

## Overview

Raft is a consensus algorithm designed to maintain consistency across distributed systems. This implementation simulates a cluster of nodes and their interactions using Raft.

The repository includes the following key components:
- `Node` class for each server in the cluster.
- Network communication between nodes using RPC (`grpc`).
- Cluster management logic, including leader election and fault tolerance.
- Interface for applying committed entries to the state machine.
- Functions for managing persistent storage of logs and state.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- `grpcio` and `grpcio-tools` packages
- `protobuf` package

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```shell
pip install grpcio grpcio-tools protobuf


# Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository:
## git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepository.git
Navigate to the repository directory:

shell
Copy code
cd YourRepository
How to Run
Run the Main Script: Execute the main script (main.py) to start the Raft cluster simulation:
shell
Copy code
python3 main.py
This will start the servers for each node and begin the simulation loop.
Observe the Output: Monitor the terminal for information about the behavior of the nodes, leader elections, log replication, and state machine application.
Inject Faults (Optional): To test fault tolerance, you can simulate node failures by terminating node processes and observing how the cluster recovers.
Terminate the Simulation: You can terminate the simulation at any time by pressing Ctrl + C in the terminal.
Project Structure
Here's an overview of the files and directories in this repository:

main.py: Entry point of the application. Initializes and runs the Raft cluster simulation.
node.py: Contains the Node class representing each server in the cluster.
communication.py: Manages network communication between nodes using RPC.
cluster.py: Contains the logic for managing the cluster of nodes, including leader election and fault tolerance.
state_machine.py: Contains an interface for applying committed entries to the state machine.
persistence.py: Manages persistent storage of logs and state.
Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you would like to improve the implementation, add new features, or fix issues, feel free to open a pull request. Make sure to follow the repository's contribution guidelines.
